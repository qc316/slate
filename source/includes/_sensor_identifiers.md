# <span style="color:#7be0d8">Physical Sensor Identifiers</span>

A node supports various and multiple soil sensors which are identified by a number as shown in the table below. For simplicity, the battery level is denoted as a sensor and is sent once a day by each sensor. However, please notice that the battery field may not be populated on this demonstration API.

Sensor type     | Sensor Identifier
--------------- | -----------------
Temperature     | 0
Soil moisture   | 1
Salinity        | 2
Battery         | 7
